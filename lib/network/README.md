# Network Manager

Manages the default virtual network for instances.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Network Model | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Linux | Bridge + TAP | Linux bridge with TAP devices per VM, iptables NAT |
| macOS | NAT | Virtualization.framework built-in NAT (192.168.64.0/24) |

On macOS, the network manager skips bridge/TAP creation since vz provides NAT networking automatically.

---

## Linux Networking

On Linux, hypeman manages a virtual network using a Linux bridge and TAP devices.

```

**Key concepts:**

- **TAP device**: A virtual network interface. Each VM gets one (unless networking is disabled). It's like a virtual ethernet cable connecting the VM to the host.

- **Bridge**: A virtual network switch inside the kernel. All TAP devices connect to it. The bridge has an IP (the gateway) that VMs use as their default route.

- **Linux kernel as router**: The kernel routes packets between the bridge (VM network) and the uplink (physical network). iptables NAT rules translate VM private IPs to the host's public IP for outbound traffic.

**What Hypeman creates:**
1. One bridge (`vmbr0`) with the gateway IP (e.g., `10.100.0.1`)
2. One TAP device per networked VM (e.g., `hype-abc123`)
3. iptables rules for NAT and forwarding

This setup allows for VMs with an attached network to communicate to the internet and for programs on the host to connect to the VMs via their private IP addresses.

## Overview

Hypeman provides a single default network that all instances can optionally connect to. There is no support for multiple custom networks - instances either have networking enabled (connected to the default network) or disabled (no network connectivity).

## Design Decisions

### State Derivation (No Central Allocations File)

**What:** Network allocations are derived from Cloud Hypervisor and snapshots, not stored in a central file.

**Why:**
- Single source of truth (CH and snapshots are authoritative)
- Self-contained guest directories (delete directory = automatic cleanup)
- No state drift between allocation file and reality
- Follows instance manager's pattern

**Sources of truth:**
- **Active VMs** (`Running` or `Initializing`): Query `GetVmInfo()` from Cloud Hypervisor - returns IP/MAC/TAP
- **Standby VMs**: Read `guests/{id}/snapshots/snapshot-latest/config.json` from snapshot
- **Stopped VMs**: No network allocation

`Initializing` is treated as fully VMM-active for networking; startup work such as async kernel-headers setup does not change network allocation behavior.

**Metadata storage:**
```
/var/lib/hypeman/guests/{instance-id}/
  metadata.json        # Contains: network_enabled field (bool)
  snapshots/
    snapshot-latest/
      config.json      # Cloud Hypervisor's config with IP/MAC/TAP
```

### Hybrid Network Model

**Standby → Restore: Network Fixed**
- TAP device deleted on standby (VMM shutdown)
- Snapshot `config.json` preserves IP/MAC/TAP names
- Restore recreates TAP with same name
- DNS entries unchanged
- Fast resume path

**Shutdown → Boot: Network Reconfigurable**
- TAP device deleted, DNS unregistered
- Can boot with different network settings (enabled/disabled)
- Allows upgrades, migrations, reconfiguration
- Full recreate path

### Default Network

- Auto-created on first `Initialize()` call
- Configured from environment variables (BRIDGE_NAME, SUBNET_CIDR, SUBNET_GATEWAY)
- Named "default" (only network in the system)
- Always uses bridge_slave isolated mode for VM-to-VM isolation

### Name Uniqueness

Instance names must be globally unique:
- Enforced at allocation time by checking all running/standby instances
- Simpler than per-network scoping

### DNS Configuration

Guests are configured to use external DNS servers directly (no internal DNS server needed):
- Configurable via `DNS_SERVER` environment variable (default: 1.1.1.1)
- Set in guest's `/etc/resolv.conf` during boot

### Dependencies

**Go libraries:**
- `github.com/vishvananda/netlink` - Bridge/TAP operations (standard, used by Docker/K8s)

**Shell commands:**
- `iptables` - Complex rule manipulation not well-supported in netlink
- `ip link set X type bridge_slave isolated on` - Netlink library doesn't expose this flag

### Prerequisites

Before running Hypeman, ensure IPv4 forwarding is enabled:

```bash
# Enable IPv4 forwarding (temporary - until reboot)
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# Enable IPv4 forwarding (persistent across reboots)
echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

**Why:** Required for routing traffic between VM network and external network. Hypeman will check this at startup and fail with an informative error if not enabled.

### Permissions

Network operations require `CAP_NET_ADMIN` and `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capabilities.

**Installation requirement:**
```bash
sudo setcap 'cap_net_admin,cap_net_bind_service=+eip' /path/to/hypeman
```

**Capability flags explained:**
- `e` = effective (capabilities are active)
- `i` = inheritable (can be passed to child processes)
- `p` = permitted (capabilities are available)

**Why:** 
- Narrowly scoped permissions (not full root), standard practice for network services
- The `i` flag allows child processes (like `ip` and `iptables` commands) to inherit `CAP_NET_ADMIN` via ambient capabilities, avoiding the need to grant system-wide capabilities to `/usr/bin/ip` or `/usr/sbin/iptables`

## Filesystem Layout

```
/var/lib/hypeman/
  network/            # Network state directory (reserved for future use)
  guests/
    {instance-id}/
      metadata.json   # Contains: network_enabled field (bool)
      snapshots/
        snapshot-latest/
          config.json # Contains: IP/MAC/TAP (source of truth)
```

## Network Operations

### Initialize
- Create default network bridge (vmbr0 or configured name)
- Assign gateway IP
- Setup iptables NAT and forwarding

### CreateAllocation
1. Get default network details
2. Check name uniqueness globally
3. Allocate next available IP (starting from .2, after gateway at .1)
4. Generate MAC (02:00:00:... format - locally administered)
5. Generate TAP name (tap-{first8chars-of-instance-id})
6. Create TAP device and attach to bridge

### RecreateAllocation (for restore from standby)
1. Derive allocation from snapshot config.json
2. Recreate TAP device with same name
3. Attach to bridge with isolation mode
4. Reapply rate limits from instance metadata

### ReleaseAllocation (for shutdown/delete)
1. Derive current allocation
2. Remove HTB class from bridge (if upload limiting enabled)
3. Delete TAP device

## Bidirectional Rate Limiting

Network bandwidth is limited separately for download and upload directions:

```

```

### Download (external → VM)
- **Method:** TBF (Token Bucket Filter) on TAP device egress
- **Behavior:** Queues packets to smooth traffic, doesn't drop
- **Per-VM:** Each TAP gets its own shaper, independent

### Upload (VM → external)
- **Method:** HTB (Hierarchical Token Bucket) on bridge egress
- **Behavior:** Fair sharing with guaranteed rates and burst ceilings
- **Per-VM:** Each VM gets an HTB class with:
  - `rate`: Guaranteed bandwidth (always available)
  - `ceil`: Burst ceiling (can use more when others are idle)
  - `fq_codel`: Leaf qdisc for low latency

### Why Different Methods?

| Direction | Bottleneck | Solution |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Download | Physical NIC ingress | Shape before delivery to each TAP |
| Upload | Physical NIC egress (shared) | Centralized HTB for fair arbitration |

**Policing (drop-based) was rejected** because it causes TCP to oscillate due to congestion control reacting to packet loss. Shaping (queue-based) provides smoother, more predictable throughput.

### Default Limits

When not specified in the create request:
- Both download and upload = `(vcpus / cpu_capacity) * network_capacity`
- Symmetric by default
- Upload ceiling = 4x guaranteed rate (configurable via `UPLOAD_BURST_MULTIPLIER`)

Note: In case of unexpected scenarios like power loss, straggler TAP devices may persist until manual cleanup or host reboot.

## IP Allocation Strategy

- Gateway at .1 (first IP in subnet)
- Instance IPs start from .2
- **Random allocation** with up to 5 retry attempts
  - Picks random IP in usable range
  - Checks for conflicts
  - Retries if conflict found
  - Falls back to sequential scan if all random attempts fail
- Helps distribute IPs across large subnets (especially /16)
- Reduces conflicts when moving standby VMs across hosts
- Skip network address, gateway, and broadcast address
- RNG seeded with timestamp for uniqueness across runs

## Concurrency & Locking

The network manager uses a single mutex to protect allocation operations:

### Locked Operations
- **CreateAllocation**: Prevents concurrent IP allocation

### Unlocked Operations  
- **RecreateAllocation**: Safe without lock - protected by instance-level locking, doesn't allocate IPs
- **ReleaseAllocation**: Safe without lock - only deletes TAP device
- **Read operations** (GetAllocation, ListAllocations, NameExists): No lock needed - eventual consistency is acceptable

### Why This Works
- Write operations are serialized to prevent race conditions
- Read operations can run concurrently for better performance
- Internal calls (e.g., CreateAllocation → ListAllocations) work because reads don't lock
- Instance manager already provides per-instance locking for state transitions

## Security

**Bridge_slave isolated mode:**
- Prevents layer-2 VM-to-VM communication
- VMs can only communicate with gateway (for internet access)
- Instance proxy could route traffic between VMs if needed in the future

**iptables rules:**
- NAT for outbound connections
- Stateful firewall (only allow ESTABLISHED,RELATED inbound)
- Default DENY for forwarding
- Rules added on Initialize, per-subnet basis

## Testing

Network manager tests create real network devices (bridges, TAPs) and require elevated permissions.

### Running Tests

```bash
make test
```

The Makefile compiles test binaries and grants capabilities via `sudo setcap`, then runs tests as your user (not root).

### Test Isolation

Network integration tests use per-test unique configuration for safe parallel execution:

- Each test gets a unique bridge and /29 subnet in 172.16.0.0/12 range
- Bridge names: `t{3hex}` (e.g., `t5a3`, `tff2`)
- 131,072 possible test networks (supports massive parallelism)
- Tests run safely in parallel with `t.Parallel()`
- Hash includes test name + PID + timestamp + random = cross-run safe

**Subnet allocation:**
- /29 subnets = 6 usable IPs per test (sufficient for test cases)
- Each test creates independent bridge on unique IP

### Cleanup

Cleanup happens automatically via `t.Cleanup()`, which runs even on test failure or panic.

### Unit Tests vs Integration Tests

- **Unit tests** (TestGenerateMAC, etc.): Run without permissions, test logic only
- **Integration tests** (TestInitializeIntegration, TestCreateAllocationIntegration, etc.): Require permissions, create real devices

All tests run via `make test` - no separate commands needed.
